York Baile Hill is the surprisingly popular York Whiteletter font, freed from the surly bonds of its banner background. With the addition of lowercase and extended language support, York Baile Hill is a versatile display face that hasnâ€™t forgotten its wood type origins.

York Baile Hill is free for personal and not for profit use, but a donation is required for ANY commercial use. A donation, of any size grants licence to use York Baile Hill for commercial purposes.
